Get node from DOM and add style

const body=document.querySelector('body)

body.style.background='red'

Add event listener
body.addEventListener('click',function)

we implemented a price calculator, which shows how to get value from forms dynamically and change the dom accordingly.
we implemented a crazy button, which shows  innerWidth and clientWidth proprieties.
we implemented a stop watch, which shows how to use data-action attribute, setInterval/clearInterval.
we implemented an accordion.
we implemented a scrolling line, which shows the debounce function to delay call to a function.

Most enlight part of the video? How many things javascript allow us to build with not to many lines
The complex part part were: remebering the right function used,look for the debounce function implementation, good querySelectors, implementing the code using modern bootstrap.
